    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Here's a simple recipe for making homemade yogurt — creamy, tangy, and customizable. You only need two ingredients, and no fancy equipment is required (though a thermometer helps).
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>


    <ul>
        <li>1 liter (4 cups) whole milk (for creamiest texture — but you can use 2% or skim)</li>
        <li>22 tbsp plain yogurt with live active cultures (as your starter)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the Milk
            <ul>
                <li>Pour the milk into a saucepan.</li>
                <li>Slowly heat over medium heat to 85°C (185°F) — stir occasionally so it doesn’t scorch.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and let it cool to 43–46°C (110–115°F).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

         <li>Add the Starter
            <ul>
                <li>In a small bowl, mix the 2 tbsp of plain yogurt with a few spoonfuls of the cooled milk.</li>
                <li>Whisk to combine, then stir it back into the pot of warm milk.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Incubate the Yogurt
            <ul>
                <li>Pour the mixture into a clean container (or leave it in the pot).</li>
                <li>Cover with a lid or plastic wrap.</li>
                <li>Keep it warm and still for 6 to 12 hours. The longer it sits, the tangier it becomes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Ways to incubate a yoghurt without a yoghurt maker:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Wrap the container in a towel and place in an oven (turned off) with the light on.</li>
                <li>Place it in a microwave with the door closed.</li>
                <li>Use a heating pad on low under a towel.</li>
            </ul>

        </li>

        <li>Check and Chill
            <ul>
                <li>After incubation, the yogurt should look set (like soft custard) and smell tangy.</li>
                <li>Chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours to fully firm up.</li>>
            </ul>
        </li>


        <li>Enjoy!
            <ul>
                <li>Stir before serving if it's separated (whey is normal).</li>
                <li>Store in the fridge for up to 7-10 days.</li>
                <li>Save a few tablespoons to use as your next batch’s starter!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ol>

    <h2>Optional Add-ins (after chilling):</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Fresh fruit or fruit compote</li>
        <li>Honey or maple syrup</li>
        <li>Granola</li>
        <li>Vanilla or cinnamon</li>
        <li>Jam swirl</li>
       
    </ul>
